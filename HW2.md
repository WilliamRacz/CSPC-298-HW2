## Part 1:
I contributed to the Graffiti Talk page discussion under “Art or vandalism?”  I added the second paragraph to this screenshot:

## Part 2:

Topic: Wikipedia and Bias

When I contributed to the Graffiti Talk page, I noticed how the debate over graffiti as art vs. vandalism shows
how perspective shapes Wikipedia articles. If editors mostly see graffiti as vandalism,
articles lean toward crime/legal issues.

This led me to a possible research question:  
Is bias on Wikipedia more likely to appear in cultural topics like graffiti, where values differ, 
than in scientific topics?
